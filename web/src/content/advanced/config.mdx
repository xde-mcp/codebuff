# Configuration

Configure Codebuff with `codebuff.json` in your project root.

## Why configure Codebuff?

It lets Codebuff start your dev stack and keep the workflow in one place instead of juggling terminals.

### Startup Processes

Set startup processes that run in the background every time Codebuff starts:

1. Start your servers (frontend, backend, etc.)
2. Launch databases or other services
3. Stream logs and surface errors

Start Codebuff once, write code, and close it when you're done. It will stop the processes it started.

## Configuration Schema

The configuration file follows this structure:

<SchemaDisplay />

## Example Configuration

Example that starts a dev server and database:

<CodeDemo language="json">
```
{
  "description": "Development environment configuration",
  "startupProcesses": [
    {
      "name": "nextjs-server",
      "command": "npm run dev",
      "cwd": "./web",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "database",
      "command": "docker-compose up",
      "cwd": "./backend/db",
      "stdoutFile": "logs/db-stdout.log",
      "stderrFile": "logs/db-stderr.log"
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeDemo>

## Best Practices

1. Name processes clearly.
2. Use relative `cwd` paths so configs travel well.
3. Log important services with `stdoutFile`/`stderrFile`.
4. Toggle processes with `enabled` instead of deleting them.

## Troubleshooting

If your startup processes aren't working as expected:

1. Check that the commands work when run manually from the specified working directory
2. Verify that any referenced paths (for logs or cwd) exist and are writable
3. Check the process output in the specified log files if you've configured them
4. Make sure the JSON syntax in your configuration file is valid
