# How does Codebuff actually work?

Codebuff scans your repo with tree-sitter and builds a quick index of the code. That index makes it fast to find files when you ask for help.

The server is stateless. It proxies requests to Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini over websockets and streams results back to the CLI.

We use a fast model to pick files, load the right snippets into context, and let Claude Sonnet propose an edit. The main agent can hand work to other agents for planning or file search when needed.
