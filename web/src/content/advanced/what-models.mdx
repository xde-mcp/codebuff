# What models do you use?

We pick models by task:

- **Claude Opus 4.5** - Primary model for default and max modes
- **Grok 4.1 Fast** - Used in lite mode for speed
- **GPT-5** - Used for certain editing tasks
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash** - File discovery and thinking tasks
- **Relace AI** - Speculative decoding for fast file rewrites

See [Modes](/docs/tips#modes) for how each mode uses different model configurations.
