# FAQ

## What can Codebuff be used for?

Writing features, tests, and scripts across common languages and frameworks. It can also run CLI commands, adjust build configs, review code, and answer questions about your repo.

## What should I try first?

Start from a [starter template](https://github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff-community/tree/main/starter-templates) or [community showcase](https://github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff-community/tree/main/showcase):

```bash
codebuff --create nextjs my-app
```

Or:

```bash
codebuff --create minecraft-simple
```

## What model does Codebuff use?

Multiple models: Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 for most coding, GPT-5 for quick edits, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash for discovery and thinking tasks, plus speculative decoding from Relace AI for faster file rewrites.

## Do you store my data?

We don't store your codebase. The server forwards requests to model providers. We keep small slices of chat logs for debugging.

## Is Codebuff open source?

Yes. It's Apache 2.0 at [github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff](https://github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff).

## Can I trust Codebuff with full access to my terminal?

If you want isolation, use the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff-community/tree/main/utils/docker) to run Codebuff against a scoped copy of your codebase.

## Can I specify custom instructions for Codebuff?

Yes. Add `knowledge.md` files to describe patterns, constraints, and commands. Files ending in `knowledge.md` load automatically. Codebuff updates existing ones but won't create them unless you ask.

## Can I tell Codebuff to ignore certain files?

Codebuff by default will not read files that are specified in your `.gitignore`. You can also create a `.codebuffignore` file to specify additional files or folders to ignore.

### What if I want Codebuff to not ignore some files in the `.gitignore`?

The `.codebuffignore` follows standard `.gitignore` negation rules as well! So to ignore a file from git but not from Codebuff:

```.gitignore
path/to/file
```

```.codebuffignore
!path/to/file
```

Take note that if you want to negate something in a nested subdirectory, you need to first negate each of the parent directories first (assuming they were ignored by some other rule). So something like:

```.gitignore
# ignore everything
**
```

```.codebuffignore
# negate: path/to/file
!path/to/
!path/to/file
```

The final set of files ignored by Codebuff are determined by the contents of `.gitignore`, followed by the contents of `.codebuffignore`.

## Why does Codebuff cost more?

We run more model calls and feed more of your codebase to get tighter edits. That costs more per request, but per benchmark we are still [cheaper than some options](https://x.com/jahooma/status/1894224663817195599).

## How does Codebuff compare to Claude Code?

See [Codebuff vs Claude Code](/docs/advanced#codebuff-vs-claude-code) for a detailed comparison. Short version: Codebuff is faster, cheaper, and handles large codebases better.
