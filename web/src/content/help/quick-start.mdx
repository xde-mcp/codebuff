# Getting Started

Install Codebuff and run it from your project.

## Installation

Install globally with npm:

```bash
  npm install -g codebuff
```

## Basic Usage

Run Codebuff in your project directory:

```bash
  codebuff
```

Or start a new project with a [starter template](https://github.com/CodebuffAI/codebuff-community/tree/main/starter-templates):

```bash
  codebuff --create nextjs project-name
```

That's enough to begin.

## Troubleshooting Install

If you run into issues during installation:

1. **Check Node Version**
   - Make sure you have [Node version 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed
   - Verify your version: `node --version`

2. **Permission Issues**
   - On Mac/Linux: Try `sudo npm install -g codebuff`
   - On Windows: Run command prompt as administrator

3. **Still Having Problems?**
   - Try reinstalling Node using [nvm or fnm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   - Run the Codebuff install command again
