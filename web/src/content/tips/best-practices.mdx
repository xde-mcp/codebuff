# Codebuff Best Practices

Habits that make Codebuff more useful.

## Start in a Git Repo

Run Codebuff inside a git repo so you can track and revert changes.

## Leverage `.gitignore` in your repo

Codebuff skips files in `.gitignore`. For files you keep in git but want Codebuff to avoid, add `.codebuffignore`.

## Planning

Codebuff can outline work before editing. Drop a rough description of the feature, then ask it to turn that into a plan in `plan.md`. Review and adjust the plan, then point Codebuff at it when you start coding.

## Include docs by link

Share URLs and Codebuff will scrape them to markdown. You can also drop links into `knowledge.md` so they load on startup. Useful for API docs, framework guides, or design references.
