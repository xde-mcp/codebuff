# Special commands

Commands inside Codebuff:

- `login` to log into Codebuff
- `undo` or `u`: Undo last change
- `redo` or `r` : Redo change
- `diff` or `d` to show changes from last assistant response
- `ESC` or `Ctrl/Cmd + C` to stop generation
- `usage` to show current credit usage
- `clear` to clear terminal screen

## Command Line Flags

- `--help`: list options
- `--lite`: faster, cheaper responses
- `--max`: more context for hard work
- `--plan`: plan only, no file changes

See [Modes](/docs/tips#modes) for details on each mode.

## Terminal commands

- Type two spaces in a row to insert a line break - useful for writing multi-line prompts
- Use Codebuff like a terminal by entering terminal commands directly, like `cd backend` or `npm test`
- `/run <command>`: run long terminal commands explicitly
