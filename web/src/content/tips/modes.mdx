# Modes

Codebuff has four modes. Switch with flags or cycle using `Ctrl+M` in the CLI.

## Default

Standard mode with Claude Opus 4.5:

- Spawns file pickers and code searchers to gather context
- Uses the `editor` agent for code changes
- Spawns `thinker` for complex problems
- Runs code review after changes
- Validates with typechecks and tests

```bash
codebuff  # no flag needed
```

## Lite (`--lite`)

Faster and cheaper with Grok 4.1 Fast:

- Reduced file context gathering
- Uses `editor-gpt-5` for code changes
- Skips code review
- No todo tracking or followup suggestions

Best for quick fixes and simple questions.

```bash
codebuff --lite
```

## Max (`--max`)

Uses Claude Opus 4.5 with more context gathering:

- Reads 12-20+ files per task for deeper context
- Uses `editor-multi-prompt` which generates multiple implementation proposals and picks the best
- Spawns `thinker-best-of-n-opus` for complex problems (multiple reasoning paths)
- Full code review after changes
- Validates both specific changes and the full project

Best for complex features and refactors.

```bash
codebuff --max
```

## Plan (`--plan`)

Planning mode. No file writes.

- Gathers context about your codebase
- Asks clarifying questions using `ask_user`
- Outputs a spec/plan wrapped in `<PLAN>` tags
- Includes requirements, constraints, and relevant files

Use this to scope out work before implementing, or to discuss approaches without making changes.

```bash
codebuff --plan
```
