# Version Control Features

## Undo and Redo Changes

If a change isn't right:

- Type `undo` or `u` to remove the last change
- Type `redo` or `r` to reapply a change you undid
- Type `diff` or `d` to see what changes were made in the last response

They mirror editor undo/redo. You can always fall back to git as well.

## Git Integration

Codebuff works alongside your existing git workflow:

- Changes are made to your working directory
- You maintain control over what gets committed
- Review changes with `git diff` before committing
- Use normal git commands to manage your repository

Ask Codebuff to draft commit messages:

```bash
  Can you create a commit message, based on the files we just changed?
```
