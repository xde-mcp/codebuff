# Where Codebuff Shines

## Refactor Files

Good for heavy edits:

- Convert files between languages while preserving functionality
- Update code to use new APIs or libraries
- Implement consistent patterns across your codebase
- Reorganize file structure for better maintainability

It keeps patterns consistent as you evolve the code.

## Multi-file Edits

Strong at cross-file work:

- Rename functions, classes, or variables across the entire codebase
- Update API endpoints and their corresponding client code
- Modify shared types and update all their usages
- Add new features that require changes in multiple parts of the application

## Code Generation

Useful for boilerplate:

- Create new API endpoints with proper logging and error handling
- Generate TypeScript types from existing code
- Add test cases for new functionality
- Create documentation files in markdown format

## Terminal Integration

It can run commands while working:

- Install new dependencies with the correct package manager
- Run type checks and tests after making changes
- Search through code using grep or other tools
- Move, rename, or delete files as part of refactoring

## Knowledge Management

Codebuff reads `knowledge.md` files to keep your context handy:

- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Architecture decisions and their rationale
- Best practices for different parts of the codebase

Update them anytime; Codebuff loads them on start.
